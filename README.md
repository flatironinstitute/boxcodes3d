# boxcodes3d

This repository contains fast multipole methods
for continuous charge densities ("box codes").
There are utilities for evaluating volume
potentials for the Laplace and Helmholtz equations.
There are also iterative solvers available for the variable
coefficient Helmholtz equation.

## installing boxcodes3d
